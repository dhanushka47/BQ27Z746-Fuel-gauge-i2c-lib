BQ27Z746_ConfirmEnabledFeatures : Confirms the status of various features like FET, protections, and configurations.
BQ27Z746_IsFETEnabled : Checks if the Field-Effect Transistor (FET) is enabled.
3. Usage Guidelines
Follow these steps to use the BQ27Z746 library in your project:
- Include the header file `bq27z746.h` in your project.
- Initialize the I2C interface and pass the handle to `BQ27Z746_Init`.
- Use the feature-enabling functions to configure the fuel gauge as needed.
- Retrieve data such as voltage, current, and RSOC using the appropriate getter functions.
- Use the `BQ27Z746_ConfirmEnabledFeatures` function to validate feature configurations.
4. Example Code
Below is a sample code snippet demonstrating the usage of the BQ27Z746 library:

#include "bq27z746.h"
#include <ti/drivers/I2C.h>
#include <ti/display/Display.h>

void main() {
    I2C_Handle i2c;
    Display_Handle display;

    // Initialize the I2C interface and display
    I2C_init();
    display = Display_open(Display_Type_UART, NULL);

    // Initialize the BQ27Z746 library
    if (!BQ27Z746_Init(i2c)) {
        Display_printf(display, 0, 0, "Initialization failed.
");
        return;
    }

    // Enable features
    BQ27Z746_EnableGauge();
    BQ27Z746_EnableFET();

    // Retrieve and display data
    uint16_t voltage = BQ27Z746_GetVoltage();
    Display_printf(display, 0, 0, "Voltage: %u mV
", voltage);
}

5. Notes
1. Ensure that the I2C interface is properly configured before using the library.
2. Always check the return value of each function for success or failure.
3. Consult the BQ27Z746 datasheet for detailed information on register addresses and configurations.
